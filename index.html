          <p class="desc">Almost nine months ago now, haiipara's 2023 "y2day" wasn't an album made for sales. haiipara's first full length under Maulcat, the record glistens from front to back of rave, drum & bass and signature Y2K glint..<br><br><b style="font-size: 20px;">Cassettes and CDs still available now at <a href="https://maulcat.bandcamp.com/merch">our store</a> or <a href="https://haiipara.bandcamp.com/album/y2day-2">our Bandcamp</a>.  Also streamable on haiipara's YouTube page: <a href="https://youtu.be/-JVtkFHeGJw">https://youtu.be/-JVtkFHeGJw</a></b>

          "welcome to the wonderful digital world of y2day – it’s like y2k but like ermmmm if it was today??? (bro it took me way too long to figure that one out bare with me). have you ever watched Ready Player One or gone onto Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse and thought to yourself “uhhhhh so that just happened! good golly gosh this is pretty neato, i sure wish i could find some hip tunes to fit this particular vibe!” well my friend look no further than y2da— nahhhhh i’m just messin with you this album is like a mix of The Wired from Serial Experiments Lain combined with the primordial gloop of Evangelion’s Human Instrumentality Project but if they served a bit more c*nt. more importantly than c*nt, haiipara has generously served us 14 hot tracks on this fine February Friday!
          <br><br>
          starting right from the title track, haiipara lets the listener know that this isn’t your nonna's electronic LP. hell yeah brotherrrrrr!!! our virtual tour guide otto (tbh this mf sound like The Button from youtube yall know what im talkin about) escorts the listener through the digital garden (they weren’t lying this garden sure sounds as lush as a simulated digital garden could possibly sound), the skies of azura, until we reach the HIDDEN>PALACE in which the illusion of this idealized virtual utopia starts to crack and crumble around us. fr tho this shit sound like getting chased down by sanic.exe through the backrooms, its spooky as hell. close2me and glow are 2 sexy club bangers (in an uncanny valley AI generated kind of way) to pop ur pwussy to at the clerb :3. rounding out the back half of the album after otto goes SCP mode on us, the listener has a bit of a sans undertale x Aphex Twin Avril 14th type moment of self-reflection before breaking out of the simulation (REDPILLED???) in an epic finale.<br><br>
          in summary, this album f*cks and I’m not just saying this because haiipara is my little malewife IRL. This album is like stepping into the lines of codes from your favourite flash game growing up as a child and throwing a little mini digital rave in there (like bro imagine playing run while listening to essence GAHDAMNNN). also, this album is full of fun little musical/internetpilled trainspotting moments and easter eggs, like bro really thought he could sneak in the [REDACTED] drumbreak and the [REDACTED] metal snare in there without us noticing (i know there’s lots im missing i forgor) (wait i’m listening to esc rn is that an angel dying scream from EVA????). more importantly this album is just really well arranged. pick any song off the album I guarantee with each listen that song will reveal layers upon layers of little detailed synths parts that will get stuck in your head all day. the replay value of this record is huge fr speaking from experience. CHECK IT OUT!!!"
